# To set the same options for a block of harddisks, do so with something
# like the following example options:
# harddisks="/dev/hda /dev/hdb"
# hdparm_opts="-d1 -X66"
# This is run before the configuration in hdparm.conf.  Do not use 
# ths=is arrnagement if yo uneed modules loaded for your hard disks,
# or need udev to create the nodes, or have some other local quirk
# These are better addressed with the options in /etc/hdparm.conf
#
# harddisks=""
# hdparm_opts=""
